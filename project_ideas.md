## Implementation Recommendations

Based on your requirements and the scope of a personal finance portal, I recommend starting with **Project Idea 1: Flask-based Personal Finance Dashboard** for the following reasons:

1. **Simplicity**: Flask provides a lightweight framework that's easy to understand and implement
2. **Flexibility**: You can start simple and add more complex features as needed
3. **AWS Compatibility**: Straightforward deployment to various AWS services
4. **Focus on Core Features**: Allows you to implement all requested features without unnecessary complexity

This approach will give you a functional personal finance portal that meets all your requirements while maintaining a manageable codebase and deployment process.

## Next Steps

If you choose to proceed with the Flask-based solution, the next steps would be:

1. Set up the project structure
2. Design the database schema
3. Implement user authentication
4. Create the core functionality (expense tracking, budgeting, etc.)
5. Develop the dashboard and visualization components
6. Set up AWS infrastructure for deployment
7. Deploy and test the application
